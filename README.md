This site illustrates all the edge-transitive (isotoxal) polyhedra.  This includes eleven that are neither vertex- nor face-transitive, a condition that was long though not to be possible.

The non-uniform ones each have a page and there is a 3D visualization application to enable exploration of them.
This site also hosts a PDF document enumerating them all and showing that there are no others.
