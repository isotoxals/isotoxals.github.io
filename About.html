<h2>About this site</h2>

<p>
I am a mathematician by education and inclination, a retired information systems developer by profession, and former harpsichordist by passion.

<p>
In the mathematical realm, over the years I have conducted independent research into polyhedra and cellular automata.  Did you know that if you consider polyhedra properly as surfaces that there are between 18 and 14,609 stellations of the regular Icosahedron?  It all depends on what characteristics one allows in the surface structure of a face.  Alas, I have not been able to finish that work nor write up any part of it.  What I have to offer here are my results on partially-regular polyhedra.

<p>
Have a good life.
