<h2>About this site</h2>

<p>
I am a mathematician by education and inclination, a retired information systems developer by profession, and former harpsichordist by passion.

<p>
In the mathematical realm, over the years I have conducted independent research into polyhedra, primarily concerning stellations and partial regularity.  The work on stellations is not yet ready for public consumption but I can offer this teaser:  if one considers polyhedra properly as surfaces there are between 18 and 14,609 stellations of the regular Icosahedron.  It all depends on what characteristics one allows in the surface structure of a face.  In the meantime what I have to offer here are my results on partially-regular polyhedra.

<p>
Have a good life.
